# LLM Label Validation Action Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to validate and cross-check LLM-generated labels for a dataset of 6,000 sentences. The goal is to ensure label quality and consistency through human review, automated model comparison, and iterative refinement.

## Context

- **Dataset Size**: ~6,000 sentences
- **Labels**: Generated by LLM
- **Objective**: Validate label accuracy and consistency
- **Approach**: Multi-layered validation combining human review, automated comparison, and refinement

---

## Phase 1: Random Sampling for Human Review

### Objective
Establish a baseline quality metric by having human reviewers validate a representative sample of LLM-generated labels.

### Steps

#### 1.1 Determine Sample Size
- **Recommended**: 200-300 sentences (3-5% of total dataset)
- **Rationale**:
  - Large enough for statistical significance
  - Small enough to be manageable for human reviewers
  - Provides ~95% confidence level with Â±7% margin of error

#### 1.2 Select Random Sample
- **Method**: Use stratified random sampling if labels have different categories
  - Ensure proportional representation of all label types
  - Use random seed for reproducibility

- **Tools/Scripts**:
  ```python
  # Example sampling approach
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np

  # Set seed for reproducibility
  np.random.seed(42)

  # Load dataset
  df = pd.read_csv('labeled_sentences.csv')

  # Stratified sampling (if applicable)
  sample_df = df.groupby('label', group_keys=False).apply(
      lambda x: x.sample(frac=0.05, random_state=42)
  )

  # Or simple random sampling
  # sample_df = df.sample(n=250, random_state=42)

  sample_df.to_csv('validation_sample.csv', index=False)
  ```

#### 1.3 Prepare Review Guidelines
Create clear annotation guidelines for human reviewers:
- Define each label category clearly
- Provide examples of correct labeling
- Include edge cases and how to handle them
- Create a simple review interface/spreadsheet

#### 1.4 Conduct Human Review
- **Reviewers**: 2-3 human annotators (for inter-annotator agreement)
- **Format**: Spreadsheet or annotation tool
- **Required Fields**:
  - Sentence ID
  - Original sentence
  - LLM-assigned label
  - Human-assigned label
  - Agreement (Yes/No)
  - Notes/Comments (for disagreements)

#### 1.5 Calculate Metrics
- **Agreement Rate**: Percentage where human agrees with LLM
- **Cohen's Kappa**: Measure inter-rater reliability if using multiple reviewers
- **Confusion Matrix**: Identify systematic labeling errors
- **Target**: Aim for >90% agreement rate

### Deliverables
- [ ] Sample dataset (200-300 sentences)
- [ ] Annotation guidelines document
- [ ] Completed human review spreadsheet
- [ ] Baseline metrics report

---

## Phase 2: Use Another Model for Comparison

### Objective
Automated secondary validation using a different model to identify potential labeling issues at scale.

### Steps

#### 2.1 Select Comparison Model
Choose a second model for validation:

**Option A: Different Model Architecture**
- Use a different fine-tuned RoBERTa checkpoint
- Try a different model family (BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT)
- Consider a larger/smaller model variant

**Option B: Alternative Approach**
- Use zero-shot classification (e.g., BART, T5)
- Try few-shot learning with GPT-3.5/GPT-4
- Use rule-based heuristics as sanity check

**Recommendation**: Start with a different RoBERTa checkpoint or BERT-based model for consistency

#### 2.2 Run Comparison on Sample
- Run the second model on the same 200-300 sentence sample
- Compare outputs between:
  - Original LLM labels
  - Human review labels (from Phase 1)
  - Second model labels

#### 2.3 Analyze Agreement Patterns
Calculate agreement metrics:
```python
# Calculate three-way agreement
from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score, classification_report

# Model 1 vs Model 2
model_agreement = (labels_model1 == labels_model2).mean()

# Model 1 vs Human
human_model1_kappa = cohen_kappa_score(labels_human, labels_model1)

# Model 2 vs Human
human_model2_kappa = cohen_kappa_score(labels_human, labels_model2)

# Identify high-confidence agreements (both models agree)
high_confidence = (labels_model1 == labels_model2)

# Identify discrepancies needing review
discrepancies = (labels_model1 != labels_model2)
```

#### 2.4 Scale to Full Dataset (Optional)
If computational resources allow:
- Run second model on entire 6,000 sentence dataset
- Flag sentences where models disagree for manual review
- Prioritize reviewing high-disagreement cases

### Deliverables
- [ ] Second model selection rationale document
- [ ] Comparison model predictions on sample
- [ ] Agreement analysis report
- [ ] List of flagged discrepancies

## Phase 3: Spot-Check Discrepancies and Adjust

### Objective
Investigate disagreements, identify patterns, and refine the labeling process.

### Steps

#### 3.1 Categorize Discrepancies
Group disagreements by type:
- **Type A**: Human disagrees with both models
- **Type B**: Models agree but human disagrees
- **Type C**: Human agrees with Model 2 but not Model 1
- **Type D**: Edge cases/ambiguous sentences

#### 3.2 Deep-Dive Analysis
For each discrepancy type:
1. **Identify Patterns**
   - Are certain label categories more problematic?
   - Do errors occur with specific sentence structures?
   - Are there domain-specific terms causing confusion?

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Model limitations (training data, architecture)
   - Ambiguous label definitions
   - Edge cases not covered in guidelines
   - Data quality issues (typos, formatting)

#### 3.3 Refine Labeling Approach
Based on findings:

**Option 1: Update Label Definitions**
- Clarify ambiguous category definitions
- Add examples for edge cases
- Update annotation guidelines

**Option 2: Re-label Problematic Categories**
- Identify categories with <80% agreement
- Re-run LLM with improved prompts
- Add few-shot examples to prompts

**Option 3: Model Fine-tuning**
- Create gold-standard training set from human-validated samples
- Fine-tune model on corrected labels
- Re-evaluate on held-out test set

**Option 4: Hybrid Approach**
- Use high-confidence automated labels (both models agree)
- Flag low-confidence cases for human review
- Implement confidence thresholds

#### 3.4 Implement Corrections
1. Create correction pipeline
2. Document decisions and rationale
3. Update affected labels in main dataset
4. Re-validate corrected samples

#### 3.5 Final Validation Round
- Re-sample 50-100 sentences (including previously problematic ones)
- Repeat human review
- Verify improvements in agreement metrics
- Target: >95% agreement on final validation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Discrepancy analysis report with categorization
- [ ] Pattern identification document
- [ ] Refined labeling guidelines/prompts
- [ ] Updated dataset with corrections
- [ ] Final validation results
