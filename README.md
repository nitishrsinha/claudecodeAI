# Claude Code Web Setup Guide

Welcome to Claude Code! This guide will walk you through setting up and using Claude Code in your web browser.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI and web-based tool for Claude, designed to help with software engineering tasks. It provides an interactive environment where you can work with Claude to write code, debug, refactor, and manage your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code on the web, ensure you have:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge - latest version recommended)
- An Anthropic API key (get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
- Stable internet connection
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started with Claude Code Web

### Option 1: Using Claude.ai (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Navigate to Claude.ai**
   - Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
   - Sign in with your Anthropic account

2. **Access Claude Code**
   - Look for the Claude Code option in the interface
   - Select "Start Claude Code Session"

3. **Configure Your Workspace**
   - You can connect to a remote workspace or use a local environment
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to set up your preferences

### Option 2: Self-Hosted Web Interface

If you're hosting Claude Code yourself:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code.git
   cd claude-code
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Start the Web Server**
   ```bash
   npm run start:web
   # or
   yarn start:web
   ```

5. **Access the Interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the Claude Code web interface

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

You can configure your API key in several ways:

1. **Environment Variable** (Recommended for self-hosted)
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configuration File**
   Create a `~/.claude/config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "apiKey": "your_api_key_here"
   }
   ```

3. **Web Interface Settings**
   - Navigate to Settings in the web UI
   - Enter your API key in the appropriate field
   - Save your configuration

### Workspace Configuration

Configure your workspace by:

1. Setting your preferred working directory
2. Configuring git settings (username, email)
3. Setting up custom commands and hooks
4. Configuring editor preferences

## Using Claude Code on the Web

### Basic Usage

1. **Start a New Session**
   - Click "New Session" or use the command palette
   - Type your request or question

2. **Working with Files**
   - Claude can read, edit, and create files in your workspace
   - Use natural language to describe what you want to do
   - Example: "Create a new Python file that implements a binary search algorithm"

3. **Running Commands**
   - Claude can execute bash commands
   - Example: "Run the tests" or "Install the dependencies"

4. **Code Review and Refactoring**
   - Ask Claude to review your code
   - Request refactoring suggestions
   - Get explanations for complex code sections

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Slash Commands**: Create reusable commands for common tasks
- **Hooks**: Set up automated responses to events
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to Model Context Protocol servers
- **Task Management**: Use built-in todo tracking for complex tasks

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Project Setup
```
"Set up a new React project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS"
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```
"There's a bug in the authentication logic. The user stays logged in even after the token expires."
```

### 3. Feature Implementation
```
"Add a dark mode toggle to the application"
```

### 4. Code Review
```
"Review the changes in src/utils/helpers.js and suggest improvements"
```

### 5. Refactoring
```
"Refactor the UserService class to use async/await instead of promises"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to Claude Code
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure the API key is valid

### API Rate Limits

**Problem**: Requests are being throttled
- **Solution**: Check your API usage at console.anthropic.com and upgrade your plan if needed

### File Access Issues

**Problem**: Claude cannot read or modify files
- **Solution**: Ensure proper permissions are set on your workspace directory

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow response times
- **Solution**:
  - Check your internet connection speed
  - Reduce the size of files being processed
  - Use more specific queries to reduce processing time

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions for better results
2. **Iterate**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps
3. **Review Changes**: Always review code changes before committing
4. **Use Version Control**: Keep your work in git for safety
5. **Leverage Todo Lists**: For complex tasks, let Claude create and manage todos

## Security Considerations

- Never share your API key publicly
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Review all code changes before deployment
- Be cautious with file system operations
- Use read-only mode when exploring unfamiliar codebases
